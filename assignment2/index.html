				<p>
				  Here are my six reasons to include meat in your diet: It's healthy. There are 29 lean cuts of beef, according to USDA standards. Beef provides nutrients like zinc, iron, protein and B vitamins, and half of the fat found in beef is monounsaturated, the same heart-healthy fats found in olive oil.

				<p>
					Nori (the seaweed wrapper) is very high in iodine, while ginger and wasabi contain various antioxidant compounds, as well as vitamins and minerals. The main part of the sushi, seafood, contains high levels of omega-3s, as well as selenium. Different types of fish contain different vitamins and minerals as well.
